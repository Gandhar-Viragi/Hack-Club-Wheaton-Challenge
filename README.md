# Hack-Club-Wheaton-Challenge
Make the Hack Club Wheaton website better-- much better!

Our current Hack Club website is just a little too basic...
We want you guys to step up to the challenge and make this website awesome!

The funny thing is, I made this website in a few hours-- I wrote no comments, my code is very messy, and my CSS and JS is on the same file as the HTML. 

My point being, be organized. Write comments so other people who will improve upon this website in the future understand what each blocks of code does. Make sure yu stay organized. 

In terms of actual suggestions to the website:

- I used the Foundation framework-- you can search up Zurb Foundation on Google to read more, but if you want to use any other framework and just code in normal HTML and CSS, go for it! Just understand that some elements on the website are special to Foundation and you may need to recreate them a different way on other environments

- The ghost animation has to go, it's pretty irrelevant and was something I came up with in the time span I had

- The second part to that would be adding a CS related animation, maybe a '</>' that alterenated with '< >'

- The title needs to be changed to 'Welcome to Hack Club Wheaton'.

- I think the title needs to be reformatted, on bigger screens it is not centered due to some Foundation code (this might be a reason not to use Foundation and try something new)

- I also think the title shoudl be reformatted such that it is a full page header, so that it has some design or background image that takes up the full screen, and then the user scrolls down for content A good example would be the Churchill Hack Club Website: https://hackclub.churchill.now.sh/

- make sure to rememeber that this website needs to work on smartphones as well!

In conclusion, be super creative. Make this website bold and super unique. Change whatever you think needs to be changed! Good luck!
